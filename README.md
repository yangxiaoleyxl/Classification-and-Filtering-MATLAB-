# Classification-and-Filtering-MATLAB-
This project is to filter selected data and print what I need to the excel files. there are two aims for me : 
(1) selected and printed companies received both stated-owned and private investment . 
(2) filtered highest investments of each of each company //
'Finalcial_test.m' is a file calling function 'findpattern.m'to select companies with stated-owned and private investments. In 'Finalcial_test.m', the basic knowledge of matrix is used. //
'Question_3' is to solve the second problem, several circulation structures were adopted in this file. //
These two files are able to cope with excel file or other datasets in specific format if some parameteres are adjusted according to the data inputed.
